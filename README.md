# Uniform-Distribution
uniform distribution refers to a type of probability distribution in which all outcomes are equally likely. A deck of cards has within it uniform distributions because the likelihood of drawing a heart, a club, a diamond, or a spade is equally likely. A coin also has a uniform distribution because the probability of getting either heads or tails in a coin toss is the same.
Uniform distributions are probability distributions with equally likely outcomes.
In a discrete uniform distribution, outcomes are discrete and have the same probability.
In a continuous uniform distribution, outcomes are continuous and infinite.
In a normal distribution, data around the mean occur more frequently.
The frequency of occurrence decreases the farther you are from the mean in a normal distribution.
